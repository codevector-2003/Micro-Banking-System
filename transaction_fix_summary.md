# Transaction Holder ID Fix

## Problem
- Backend expects `holder_id` for transactions
- Frontend was trying to use `saving_account_id` directly
- Error: "Invalid holder_id or account not found"

## Root Cause
The transaction system requires a lookup in the `AccountHolder` table to get the `holder_id` that links customers to savings accounts.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Backend Endpoint
**File:** `Backend/savingAccount.py`
```python
@router.get("/holder/{saving_account_id}")
def get_account_holder(saving_account_id: str, ...):
    # Returns holder_id for a given saving_account_id
```

### 2. Updated Frontend Transaction Service
**File:** `Frontend/src/services/agentService.ts`
- Added `getAccountHolder()` method
- Modified `createTransaction()` to:
  1. First get `holder_id` using `saving_account_id`
  2. Then create transaction with correct `holder_id`

### 3. Updated Frontend Component
**File:** `Frontend/src/components/AgentDashboard.tsx`
- Changed transaction data to use `saving_account_id` instead of `holder_id`
- Service layer now handles the holder_id lookup automatically

## Transaction Flow (After Fix)
1. User selects account and enters transaction details
2. Frontend calls `TransactionService.createTransaction()` with `saving_account_id`
3. Service calls `/saving-accounts/holder/{saving_account_id}` to get `holder_id`
4. Service calls `/transactions/transaction` with correct `holder_id`
5. Backend processes transaction successfully

## Testing
Run both backend and frontend, then try creating a transaction through the Agent Dashboard. The "Invalid holder_id" error should be resolved.
