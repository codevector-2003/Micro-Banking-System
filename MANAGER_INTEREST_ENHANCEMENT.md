## Technical Implementation

### API Integration
Uses Manager-specific endpoints from `ManagerTasksService`:

1. **`GET /tasks/status`**: Fetches scheduler status (read-only for managers)
2. **`GET /tasks/savings-interest-report`**: Branch-filtered savings accounts
3. **`GET /tasks/fd-interest-report`**: Branch-filtered FD deposits

**Note**: Managers do NOT have access to:
- `/tasks/start` - Only Admins can start scheduler
- `/tasks/stop` - Only Admins can stop scheduler
- `/tasks/calculate-savings-interest` - Manual calculations restricted
- `/tasks/calculate-fd-interest` - Manual calculations restricted
- `/tasks/mature-fds` - Maturity processing restricted

### State Management
Existing React state hooks:
- `taskStatus`: Scheduler status and next run times
- `savingsInterestReport`: Branch savings interest report
- `fdInterestReport`: Branch FD interest report
- `loading`: Loading state for buttons/actions

### CSV Export Implementation
Branch-specific exports with inline JavaScript:

**Savings Interest CSV:**
```typescript
const csvContent = [
  ['Account ID', 'Plan', 'Balance', 'Interest Rate', 'Potential Interest'].join(','),
  ...savingsInterestReport.accounts.map((acc: any) =>
    [
      acc.saving_account_id,
      acc.plan_name,
      acc.balance,
      acc.interest_rate,
      acc.potential_monthly_interest
    ].join(',')
  )
].join('\n');

const blob = new Blob(['\uFEFF' + csvContent], { 
  type: 'text/csv;charset=utf-8;' 
});
// Filename: branch-savings-interest-{month_year}.csv
```

**FD Interest CSV:**
```typescript
const csvContent = [
  ['FD ID', 'Account ID', 'Principal', 'Interest Rate', 'Days Since Payout', 'Potential Interest'].join(','),
  ...fdInterestReport.deposits.map((dep: any) =>
    [
      dep.fixed_deposit_id,
      dep.saving_account_id,
      dep.principal_amount,
      dep.interest_rate,
      dep.days_since_payout,
      dep.potential_interest
    ].join(',')
  )
].join('\n');

const blob = new Blob(['\uFEFF' + csvContent], { 
  type: 'text/csv;charset=utf-8;' 
});
// Filename: branch-fd-interest-{current_date}.csv
```

### Responsive Design
- **Desktop (lg+)**: Two-column layout for reports
- **Tablet (md)**: Three-column status cards, stacked report panels
- **Mobile**: Single column stack, all cards full width

### Loading States
- **Button Spinners**: Rotating RefreshCw icon during fetch
- **Report Loading**: Centered large spinner with message
- **Disabled States**: Buttons disabled during operations

## Differences from Admin Dashboard

### What Managers CAN Do:
✅ View scheduler status
✅ View next scheduled calculation times
✅ Load branch-specific interest reports
✅ View detailed tables of pending accounts/deposits
✅ Export branch data to CSV
✅ Monitor system automation

### What Managers CANNOT Do:
❌ Start/Stop automated scheduler (Admin only)
❌ Manually trigger interest calculations (Admin only)
❌ Process FD maturities manually (Admin only)
❌ See data from other branches (Branch-filtered)

### UI Differences:
- **No Manual Calculation Panel**: Removed the 3-card action panel
- **Single Load Button**: Combined load for both reports
- **Branch-Specific Data**: All data filtered to manager's branch
- **Permission Note**: Help section clarifies Admin-only actions
- **Simpler Layout**: Monitoring-focused rather than action-focused

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Enhancement
- Basic two-column layout
- Minimal report details (summary only)
- No detailed data visibility
- No CSV export functionality
- Generic titles and descriptions
- No guidance on limitations

### After Enhancement
- **Clear Status Display**: 3-card status row at top
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Detailed tables with all data
- **Export Functionality**: One-click CSV download
- **Better Organization**: Grouped by report type (savings/FD)
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Color-coded cards (green/blue)
- **Professional Tables**: Sticky headers, proper formatting, hover effects
- **Clear Guidance**: Help card explains features and permissions
- **Branch-Specific**: All data clearly filtered to manager's branch

## Color Coding System

### Status Cards
- **Scheduler Running**: Green badge (default variant)
- **Scheduler Stopped**: Gray badge (secondary variant)

### Report Cards
- **Savings Interest**: Green theme (green-50 background, green-700 text)
- **FD Interest**: Blue theme (blue-50 background, blue-700 text)

### Table Values
- **Interest Amounts (Savings)**: Green text (text-green-600)
- **Interest Amounts (FD)**: Blue text (text-blue-600)
- **Rate Badges**: Outline variant (subtle)

## Performance Considerations

### Table Virtualization
- Tables have `max-h-96` with overflow scroll
- Only visible rows rendered in viewport
- Smooth scrolling for branch data (typically <100 rows)

### Data Filtering
- Backend handles branch filtering (no frontend processing)
- Efficient query with branch_id filter
- Optimized for branch-level data volume

### API Calls
- Reports loaded on-demand (not automatic)
- Status loaded once, can be manually refreshed
- No continuous polling (reduces server load)

## Testing Checklist

### Functionality Tests
- [ ] Scheduler status displays correctly
- [ ] Next calculation times show accurate timestamps
- [ ] Savings interest report loads branch data only
- [ ] FD interest report loads branch data only
- [ ] CSV export for savings report works
- [ ] CSV export for FD report works
- [ ] CSV files contain only branch data
- [ ] CSV files open correctly in Excel
- [ ] Tables display branch accounts only
- [ ] All amounts formatted correctly (2 decimals)
- [ ] Tables scroll properly when data exceeds height

### UI/UX Tests
- [ ] Status cards display in correct order
- [ ] Color coding consistent (green/blue theme)
- [ ] Loading spinner appears during fetch
- [ ] Report cards appear after successful load
- [ ] Export buttons only show when data exists
- [ ] Tables have sticky headers
- [ ] Help guide clearly explains limitations
- [ ] Layout responsive on mobile devices
- [ ] Layout responsive on tablets
- [ ] Layout optimal on desktop

### Permission Tests
- [ ] Manager cannot start/stop scheduler
- [ ] Manager cannot manually calculate interest
- [ ] Manager cannot process FD maturities
- [ ] Manager sees only own branch data
- [ ] CSV exports contain only branch data
- [ ] No "other branch" data visible

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Empty savings report handled gracefully
- [ ] Empty FD report handled gracefully
- [ ] Report load failure shows error
- [ ] Large branch reports (50+ rows) render smoothly
- [ ] CSV export with special characters works
- [ ] Multiple rapid refreshes handled correctly

## Security & Access Control

### Backend Enforcement
- Branch filtering enforced by backend (not frontend)
- Manager's `employee_id` used to determine branch
- All queries include automatic branch filter
- Cannot access other branches' data via API

### Frontend Display
- Only shows data returned by backend
- No client-side filtering required
- CSV exports reflect backend-filtered data
- Help text clarifies permission boundaries

## Future Enhancements

### Priority 1 (High Value)
- [ ] Add notification when interest is processed
- [ ] Add historical interest payment view
- [ ] Add branch interest trends chart
- [ ] Add comparison with previous months

### Priority 2 (Nice to Have)
- [ ] Add scheduled email reports
- [ ] Add account-level interest history
- [ ] Add predictive interest calculations
- [ ] Add filter by account type

### Priority 3 (Future Consideration)
- [ ] Add PDF export with branch branding
- [ ] Add custom date range selection
- [ ] Add agent-level interest breakdown
- [ ] Add interest payment audit trail
